This is a simple node app that uses a MySQL database to do simple transactions.  

The app starts with a prompt where it takes user input 2 times. The first asks for the id of the item and the second asks for the quantity

After both inputs are entered, the code searches for the database for the id and calculates the total cost of the purchase.  The app then restarts with an updated table.

If the user inputs a quantity greater than the stock available it results in a message saying there is not enough quantity and restarts the app again.

See the Test.PNG file to see some results.
